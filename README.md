## Running Tests

### 1. Install Dependencies for Testing

If you are running tests locally (outside of Docker), make sure the testing dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install --dev
```
### 2. Running Tests Locally
To run the tests locally using npm (or your configured test script), run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
